# Python Mini Projects Collection

A beginner-friendly collection of Python mini projects, including:

- **Digital Clock (Tkinter GUI App)**  
- **Jupyter Notebook Experiments** (featuring awesome Python libraries)  
- **Sample Audio File** for testing and experiments  

This repository is perfect for Python learners who want to explore GUI apps, data analysis, visualization, and multimedia handling.

## Projects in this Repository

### 1. Digital Clock (`Python Digital_Clock.py`)
A simple GUI-based digital clock built with Python’s built-in **Tkinter** library.  
It displays the current time and updates every second.

**How to run:**

python "Python Digital_Clock.py"

Tkinter is already bundled with most Python installations (Windows/macOS).
On Linux, you may need to install:

sudo apt install python3-tk

### 2. Python Experiment Notebook (`python experiment.ipynb`)
An interactive Jupyter Notebook where different Python libraries are used for exploration and experiments.
It includes (based on imports found in the notebook):

NumPy – for numerical operations

Pandas – for data handling

Matplotlib & Seaborn – for data visualization

Requests – for fetching data from the web

Other standard libraries (like os, sys, etc.)

**How to run:**

Install Jupyter:

pip install notebook
Launch:
jupyter notebook

Open **python experiment.ipynb** and run the cells.

### 3. Sample Audio File (`MyRecording.wav`)
An example audio file included for testing purposes.
It can be used in the notebook for audio processing or playback examples.
